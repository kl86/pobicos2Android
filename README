Description:
--------------
This repository hosts the implementation of the system that was developed 
for my thesis (March - September 2011 @Uth.gr), titled "Porting the POBICOS 
middleware to Android mobile phones". POBICOS is an EU-FP7 program that was 
running for three years, from May 2008 to May 2011. For more information 
visit www.ict-pobicos.eu.

Currently, the only detailed description of the system is in Greek. Feel free
to ask a copy of my thesis at kwstasl@gmail.com .
